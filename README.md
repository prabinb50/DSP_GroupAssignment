**Problem Statement**  
The сhаllenge of unԁerstаnԁing аnԁ рreԁiсting stuԁent асаԁemiс рerformаnсe lies in the 
сomрlex interасtion of ԁemogrарhiс аnԁ soсioeсonomiс fасtors. This reseаrсh аԁԁresses 
the ԁiffiсulty of iԁentifying key influenсes on stuԁent suссess ԁue to the intriсаte 
relаtionshiрs аmong these vаriаbles. Fаilure to ассurаtely iԁentify these influenсes саn 
result in ineffeсtive interventions аnԁ suррort systems, negatively imрасting stuԁent

Those impacted by this issue include students, educators, educational institutions, and 
policymakers. Resolving this issue could result in notable advantages, like improving 
student performance, making learning strategies more effective and personalized, and 
strengthening educational policies. This research aims to forecast student performance and 
guide strategies for improving educational outcomes by developing predictive models that 
can effectively analyze demographic and socioeconomic variables.  


**Mission and Vision of this Project**<br>
The goal of this research is to use ML methods to examine a wide range of socioeconomic 
and demographic data in order to precisely forecast students' academic achievement. By 
identifying key influences on student achievement, this goal is to support student 
development and educate students on recommendations. 
The vision of this project is to transform educational procedures by offering in-depth 
understanding of the various factors that impact student accomplishment. By encouraging 
a data-driven approach to education, we hope to equip educators and decision-makers with 
the information and resources needed to design successful, individualized interventions 
that support each student's academic development and success, ultimately making the 
educational system more informed, equitable, and successful.

**Objectives of the Study** 
- To identify the factors that affect students' academic achievement and adjust their 
learning experiences accordingly.   
- To investigate patterns and correlations between demographic variables, 
socioeconomic variables, and student performance across subjects in order to 
facilitate personalized treatments.  
- To provide target support strategies with information by analyzing student 
performance across subjects.  
- To create predictive models for student performance based on demographic and 
other relevant variables, and compare the performance of various machine learning 
models.  
- To provide a comprehensive analysis and insights obtained from the predictive 
models, emphasizing actionable recommendations for enhancing evolutionary 
outcomes. 

**CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION**  
The analysis of student academic performance using different machine learning and deep learning models has revealed significant insights into the complex transaction of demographic and socioeconomic factors. Key factors such as parental education levels, past academic performance (G1 and G2 grades), and study habits developed as crucial impacts on student outcomes. Among the models tested, lasso regression demonstrated the most accurate and reliable, explaining 90%  of the variance in student performance and demonstrating the least error metrics. To differentiate, the artificial neural network (ANN) model underperformed, demonstrating that linear models are more suitable for this dataset.,<br> 
To enhance future research, it is recommended to integrate additional differing datasets, utilize  real-time information streams for energetic experiences, investigate unsupervised learning 
strategies, and incorporate more nuanced features like psychological factors and extracurricular 
activities. Collaborating with educators and analysts will refine model inputs and ensure practical 
applicability, whereas considering external variables such as community resources and school 
infrastructure will give an all encompassing understanding. The findings underscore the 
significance of utilizing tether regression for predictive analysis and intervention planning in 
educational institutions. Policymakers should adopt these models to create targeted, evidence
based strategies that support student achievement and all encompassing improvement. Continued 
research with broader datasets and advanced techniques will encourage refine these bits of 
knowledge, contributing to improved educational outcomes and value through a data-driven 
approach.
